"""Navigation-timing waterfall: one page load decomposed into independent phases.

**Silver layer.** *Bronze* is the raw W3C ``PerformanceNavigationTiming`` marks the
browser plugin captures verbatim (``performance.getEntriesByType('navigation')[0]
.toJSON()``) plus FCP/LCP from the paint observer — no abstractions. Here we turn
those absolute marks (all in ms since ``timeOrigin``, so directly comparable) into an
**additive, non-overlapping** sequence of phase *durations* that tile the whole load
left-to-right — the thing a waterfall renders, and the set of genuinely independent
measurables underneath the milestone timings.

Why this exists: FCP/LCP are measured *from navigation start*, so they silently
**include** DNS + TCP + TLS + request/TTFB. A profile can look faster on LCP purely
because the network setup happened to be quick at that moment (network "weather"),
not because shaping helped the render. Splitting the load into phases isolates:

* the **network-confounded prefix** — everything up to the first response byte
  (``responseStart``), which is baked into every paint milestone, and
* the **render residual** — ``FCP − responseStart`` and ``LCP − responseStart``, the
  part firewall shaping cannot move — as first-class, comparable numbers.

The phases telescope exactly: ``stall + dns + tcp + tls + request == responseStart``
(the cumulative TTFB), and the full chain sums to the load endpoint. Every duration
is clamped ``>= 0`` and derived purely from the stored raw, so the whole waterfall
re-derives over history with no re-collection. Gold-layer scoring is unaffected —
these are display-only measurables.
